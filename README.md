# ScratchHack
Xcode project containing the Scratch Hack application (Swift)
This is the Xcode project for the iOS application 'Scratch Hack'. 
Scratch Hack has since been removed from the Apple App Store

Classes, functions, and images found in the project can be used by all.

Code I wrote is found in the LotteryAppTest/Model and LotteryAppTest/Controller files.

This project includes some scripts used in the backend of the application. They're located in the Scripts folder. These scripts dealt with scraping scratch ticket information from state websites, formatting the information, and delivering scratch ticket infromation to the mobile application when called. There are only 2 folders for states in this repository. The other 15 states were not included as they are fairly similar. 12 webscrapers were written in php, 5 were done in Python. There's a webscraper of each language in the Scripts folder.

This app was used to display information about scratch tickets from 17 states. Users
can purchase a subscription to view scratch ticket data, namely scratch tickets in their state most likely to be winners.
