# ScratchHack
Xcode project containing the Scratch Hack application (Swift)
This is the Xcode project for the iOS application 'Scratch Hack'. 
Scratch Hack has since been removed from the Apple App Store

Classes, functions, and images found in the project can be used by all.

Code I wrote is found in the LotteryAppTest/Model and LotteryAppTest/Controller files.

This app was used to display information about scratch tickets from 17 states. Users
can purchase a subscription to view scratch ticket data, namely scratch tickets in their state most likely to be winners.
